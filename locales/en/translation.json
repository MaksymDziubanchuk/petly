Regardless of the choice of breed, children also differ in their needs, energy levels and personalities. Therefore, it is very important to make the right approach during the selection and adaptation period of the animal at home. \"When you're looking for a family pet, you usually consult with friends and family, relying on their own experience,\" says Janelle Emmett, a veterinary technologist at Carrington College in Sacramento, who has been selecting companion animals for more than 12 years. Ideally, people should choose a breed based on the dog's lifestyle. It is also worth correctly assessing the child's personality and age, comparing it with the character traits of the breed.

Proceeds from the sale of NFT illustrations will go towards supporting the animals in the shelter. This was announced in a press release by the Bickerstaff.835 agency. Initially, the authors decided to create an instruction on «how to easily distinguish dogs from pigdogs.» However, the illustrations were later turned into NFT tokens. The animal support project at Gostomel was named BARK - Best Artists Raise Kindness. Over 20 Ukrainian illustrators participated in the initiative. Their works can be purchased on the project's website. The instructions for creating a crypto wallet are also available there. Proceeds from the sale of NFT tokens will be directed towards the Gostomel animal shelter, which currently houses 500 dogs and 200 cats that have survived shelling and occupation. The animals require medical assistance, food, and water. In addition, offline applications have been developed for NFT illustration owners - for example, one can receive a military badge for leadership among free dogs or a VIP pass to the shelter with «lifetime access to pet and play with animals at any time». Those who do not want to buy a token can simply donate any amount to the shelter's account.",
